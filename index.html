        <h3>Q&amp;A</h3>
        
        <p class="question">Will the beat have tags after purchase?</p>
        <p class="answer">No. All beats will be completely untagged with every lease. A single tag is included with the trackouts though if you'd like to add it (It makes me happy &#x1F609;).</p>
        
        <p class="question">Do you have any deals?</p>
        <p class="answer">No. Beatstars doesn't pay collaborators their cut if you get the beat as the additional "free" beat. I don't think that's fair. But you can ask me for a discount on <a href="https://twitter.com/prodbyjozu">Twitter</a> (or any other platform), you might get lucky.. &#x1F937;</p>
        
        <p class="question">Do you also offer mixing services?</p>
        <p class="aswer">Yes. Contact me on any of my <a href="#social">social media accounts</a> or via <a href="#contact">email</a> for more info.</p>
        
        <p class="question">Do you use samples?</p>
        <p class="answer">Very rarely. And if so they're are completely royalty-free.</p>
        
        <p class="question">Can I get a custom made beat?</p>
        <p class="answer">If I believe I can realise your idea to your expectations, yes. Just contact me and let me know what you have in mind.</p>
        
        <p class="question">You got a different question?</p>
        <p class="answer">Feel free to ask. (social media linked below)</p>
